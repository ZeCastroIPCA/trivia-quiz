# Trivia Quiz
## Why did I make this?
Initially, I made this project to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a simple quiz game that would test the user's knowledge on a variety of topics.

## Why only updated now?
I had it in my external SSD for a while and I thought it would be a good idea to update it to my current standards.

## What to expect from this project?
This project is a very rudimentary quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on a variety of topics. Don't expect a full game with a lot of features, but rather a simple game. IT WILL NOT BE UPDATED EVER.
