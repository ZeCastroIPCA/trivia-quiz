# Trivia Quiz
## Why did I make this?
Initially, I made this project to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a simple quiz game that would test the user's knowledge on a variety of topics. I also wanted to create a project that would be fun and engaging for users to play. I chose to create a trivia quiz because I enjoy playing trivia games and thought it would be a fun project to work on.

## Why only updated now?
I had it in my external SSD for a while and I thought it would be a good idea to update it to my current standards.
